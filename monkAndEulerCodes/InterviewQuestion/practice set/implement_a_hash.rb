=begin
Implement a hash table in ruby.

Think about what methods a hash table should support.
- insert, delete, lookup, iteration

Implementation:
- use an array to store key/value pairs
- use chaining to handle collisions
- keep the load factor between some min and max value
  - load factor = (num items in hashtable / size of array)
  - typically between 0.25 and 0.75

=end

class HashTable
  MIN_LOAD_FACTOR = 0.25
  #TODO
end
